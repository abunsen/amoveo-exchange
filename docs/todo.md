Block IP’s from New York, Washington, Iran, or North Korea.  Reference restricted jurisdictions in terms of service.

Don’t host any servers in the US.

Europe – GDPR (data protection regulations) come into effect May 25th. Still unclear how exchanges should respond.  ShapeShift hasn’t released their policy re: GDPR but promises an update for the community soon – can probably piggyback on their strategy.

Terms of Service – Need to have terms of service.  Can copy and edit ShapeShift’s TOS, but there has to be some operator that is entering into the TOS with the users (probably don’t want this to be zack directly, could be a swiss or maltese corporation with zack as an owner, or whoever else as owner and just pays zack to consult.  Doesn’t really matter which from a legal standpoint).
